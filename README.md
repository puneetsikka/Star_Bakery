Star bakery analytics dashboard is fetching up data from the db and showing it with diffrent charts for the analyst to have look at :)

Just load the dump of the db from the directory shop_db in your mongodb sever

Just npm install for installing the requred libraries

Fire up the sever just run on terminal node --harmony  server.js 

Then npm start for running the application
